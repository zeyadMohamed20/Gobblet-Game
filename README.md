# Gobblet-Game
CSE472s Artificial Intelligence Course Project. This project is about implementing the game-playing of Gobblet, Gobblet game is an abstract game played on a 4x4 grid with each of the two players having twelve pieces that can nest on top of one another to create three stacks of four pieces.

1-we implemented the Data structure of the Board as a class where each board is a 2D array of cells that is defined the Cell.py

2- Also implemenrted the functions and variables used by the gui to map the board resulting from the game playing algorithms to the gui.
