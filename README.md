# Gobblet-Game
CSE472s Artificial Intelligence Course Project. This project is about implementing the game-playing of Gobblet, Gobblet game is an abstract game played on a 4x4 grid with each of the two players having twelve pieces that can nest on top of one another to create three stacks of four pieces.

1-We implemented the data structure of the cell in the board where each cell has two bitmaps one for white and the other for black, where the gobblets' sizes are encoded to 1,2,4,8 from small the big.

2-we also implemented some functions to be used in the Board class to add or move gobblets to a certain cell.
